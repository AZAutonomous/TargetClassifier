# SparseConvNet -- AZA
**THIS APPROACH IS CURRENTLY ON INDEFINITE HOLD**
Due to the complexity of the model and poor documentation, re-implementing the SparseConvNet model in TensorFlow for AZA has been halted

## Overview
The network(s) utilized here are based on the Sparse ConvNet [1] with Fractional Max Pooling [2]. Full credit for the network architecture goes to Dr. Ben Graham, (formerly) University of Warwick. More information may also be found at Dr. Graham's SparseConvNet GitHub repository [3]
