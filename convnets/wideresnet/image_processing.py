"""Read and preprocess image data.

 Image processing occurs on a single image at a time. Image are read and
 preprocessed in parallel across multiple threads. The resulting images
 are concatenated together to form a single batch for training or evaluation.

 -- Provide processed image data for a network:
 inputs: Construct batches of evaluation examples of images.
 distorted_inputs: Construct batches of training examples of images.
 batch_inputs: Construct batches of training or evaluation examples of images.

 -- Data processing:
 parse_example_proto: Parses an Example proto containing a training example
   of an image.

 -- Image decoding:
 decode_jpeg: Decode a JPEG encoded string into a 3-D float32 Tensor.

 -- Image preprocessing:
 image_preprocessing: Decode and preprocess one image for evaluation or training
 distort_image: Distort one image for training a network.
 eval_image: Prepare one image for evaluation.
 distort_color: Distort the color in one image for training.
