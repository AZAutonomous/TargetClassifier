"""Evaluation for CIFAR-10.

Accuracy:
cifar10_train.py achieves 83.0% accuracy after 100K steps (256 epochs
of data) as judged by cifar10_eval.py.

Speed:
On a single Tesla K40, cifar10_train.py processes a single batch of 128 images
in 0.25-0.35 sec (i.e. 350 - 600 images /sec). The model reaches ~86%
accuracy after 100K steps in 8 hours of training time.

Usage:
Please see the tutorial and website for how to download the CIFAR-10
data set, compile the program and train the model.
