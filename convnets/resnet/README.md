# ResNet -- AZA

## Overview
The network(s) utilized here are based on the Wide Residual Networks (WRNs) model [1][2] by Sergey Zagoruyko and Nikos Komodakis. WRNs are based on Deep Residual Networks [3] developed by Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). Its official implementation releases may be found at Kaiming He's GitHub repository [4]. A TensorFlow conversion (in progress) may be found at [5]
